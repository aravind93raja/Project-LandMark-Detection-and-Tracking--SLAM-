# Project - LandMark Detection and Tracking SLAM


In this project, I have localized a robot in a 2D grid world. The basis for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is to gather information from a robot's sensors and motions over time, and then use information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.

SLAM gives us a way to both localize a robot and build up a map of its environment as a robot moves and senses in real-time. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.

Graph SLAM Alogrithm has been used in this Project.

The Project is complete and you can find the results in3. Landmark Detection and Tracking.ipynb
